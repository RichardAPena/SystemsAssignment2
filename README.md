# Project information

Our project is a text file sharing system. This system uses a singular server that multiple clients can access to either download from the server, or upload to the server, using the UI.


# Improvements

To improve upon the base UI for this system, we added Labels to remind the user which files they currently have selected for upload/download. We also added a file preview system that displays the contents of said files on the UI.

# How-to-run

1. Before running the program, make sure the directory C:\Downloads\serverDir exists (or edit the code to change the desired server directory location)
2. Put any files you wish to upload to the server into the clientDir directory.
3. Run Main.java
4. On the left there will be the client side directory, and on the right there will be the server side directory. Click on either list to select the file you would like to upload/download. Only client side files can be uploaded, and only server side files can be downloaded.
5. Once a file is selected, download or upload it depending on whether it's client sided or server sided.
6. Exit the program when desired.
